# P4G Dialogue Visualizer
A simple program that allows to test how the dialogue line will look like in Persona 4 Golden window.

## Notes
In this repo, you can find only the visualizer. It needs three files to properly function:
* bg.jpg - a background file (preferred size: 1920x1080)
* font0.png
* font0.xml - file with fontmap information.

You can get PNG and XML file from game's font0.fnt file with tool like PersonaEditor.

Also, right now this program doesn't support Japanese characters. It's made to make Polish translation process easier and that's why it supports custom Polish font and Polish-only characters.
Japanese characters support won't be added - did you see how many kanji are there?

Right now, program displays the scene in 1/8 scale, but some configuration options will be added soon.
